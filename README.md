# Eleph
My first app so I didnt use best React practices like reusable components etc but im eager to rewrite important components of this app to suit 2021 React better. 
Also I need to add comments about what each function does. Thank U.

The idea of the application, frontend and backend and everything else is entirely my work.
This app called Eleph is a mood social network written in a React Native environment where users 
display their current mood in their posts. The graphs within the app summarize moods over specific time periods. 
Among many other functions, it is possible to search for other users, load more and refresh functions, check the Internet connection, 
load spinners, delete posts and view your own and other people's posts. Cloud Firestore (Firebase) was used for the database. 
The application is not finished yet, new features and enhancements will be added 
such as real time database listener and split state within the list (flatlist in RN).

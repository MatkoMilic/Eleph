# Eleph

[App in need of refactoring]

This app called Eleph is a mood social network written in a React Native environment where users 
display their current mood in their posts. The graphs within the app summarize moods over specific time periods. 
Among many other functions, it is possible to search for other users, load more and refresh functions, check the Internet connection, 
load spinners, delete posts and view your own and other people's posts. Cloud Firestore (Firebase) was used for the database.
